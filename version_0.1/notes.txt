#MANAGED TO CREATE A SYSTEM WERE A USER CAN BUY DINAR TOKENS.
-THE NEXT PROCESS WOULD BE TO WITHDRAW THOSE TOKENS
#MANAGED TO CREATE A WITHDRAW SYTEM, FROM THIS 
SECTION WE IMPLEMENTED THE USES OF BADGES.
-CREATE A SYSTE WHERE WE HAVE USERS AND THEY 
WANT TO SEND MONEY TO EACH OTHER
===========================================
NEED TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT JUST CHECKS THE USER
BALANCE
-NEED TO EDIT THE CODE.
#OUR BASIC FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN THE NEXT PROCESS IS 
TO ENSURE THAT THE USER CAN WITHDRAW SOME TOKENS
WE MANAGED TO CREATE A WITHDRAW SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM 
IN THE INSTANCE WE CAN CALL THE CHECK BALANCE SINCE 
IT CAN BE CALLED BY ANYONE, THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE 
HAVING IS THE WITHDRAW SINCE IT IS ATTCHED TO A METHOD
THAT REQUIRES ADMIN PRIVILAGES. 
============================================
NEED TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE, CREATE IT IN A WAY 
THAT IS IN ALIGN WITH OUR DESIGN.
