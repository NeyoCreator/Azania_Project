# Single Component  

Within this code we tried to create the basic 
component that will handle the resources that 
the user will interact with. When we instantiate 
the function we set a price of a DINAR token to 50 XRD. 
we create a method that will allow the 
user to buy tokens based on that price.

The next part will consist of the exchange that will 
happen with components.
