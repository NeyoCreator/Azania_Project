# Azanai
Through this readme, we will cover three questions regarding the project. Azania is a 
platform that provides a digital token as a medium of exchange. the token will 
be called Dinar (DN).

## __1.What are we building?__
The aim is to provide an alternative form of payment. Using stable coins as a medium 
of exchange. The image below provides an illustrated example of how the system would 
work.

## __2.Why are we building it?__
In Africa, with the current banking system it is difficult for merchants to participate
within the digital ecosystem, the reason being the difficulty of getting a bank account. 
The effects of this leads to customers only using digital payments in urban areas. 

What we aim to do is create a platform that allows easier access to banking and 
provides a better means of financial communication.

## __3.How do we plann to build it?__
Through a decentralised platform that enables merchants and customers to send and recieve
tokens as a form of payment. From a technical standpoint, we are planning to build this 
on top of the Radix platform. Currently, the code in the repo is based on a central arcitecture,
using flask framework.this is  just a starting point for prototyping reason and will be plan to 
update as we progress.
