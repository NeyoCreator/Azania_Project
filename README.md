as a medium of exchage. It uses tokens called Dinar.
Through this readme we will cover 3 questions regading
the project.

## __1.What are we building?__
The aim is to provide an alternative form of payment. Using stable coins as a medium 
of exchange. The image below provides an illistraded example of how the system would 
work.

## __2.Why are we building it?__
With the current banking  system it is difficult for merchants to participate within

The effects of this leads to customers only using digital payments in urban areas. 

What we aim to do is create a platform that allows easier access to banking and 
provides a better means of financial communication.
