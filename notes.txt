OBTAIN DATA SCRIPTS
CREATE QRCODE BASED ON SCAN
MANAGED TO CREATE SCRIPTS 
THAT ARE ABLE TO READ AND 
WRITE QR CODE, NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO 
CREATE FUNCTIONS AD IMPLEMENT THEM TO
THE APPLICATION
=====================================
CREATE A DEMO SAMPLE DATA WHERE YOU 
CAN READ DATA FROM.
READ SIMPLE DATA
=====================================
HAVE AN ACTION THAT WILL LOAD DATA FROM 
A GIVEN IMAGE CREATE UPLOAD HTML.
WANT TO UPLOAD AN IMAGE SO THAT I CAN 
LOAD SOME DATA INTO IT 
MANAGED TO UPLOAD IMAGES.
MANAGED TO READ QR CODE, WHAT i NEED TO 
DO IS PASS THE DATA SO THAT IT CAN BE READ
BY THE APPLICATION.
CREATE A PROPER QR CODE THAT HAS THE 
NEEDED DATA.
MANAGED TO CREATE A DESCENT JSON FILE, WHAT 
I WANT TO DO NOW IS DISPLAY THE DATA ON THE 
WEB.
===========================================
APPEND THE DATA INTO A JSON FILE 
MANAGED TO UPLOAD DATA INTO THE FILE 
#TRY TO ORDER THE STRUCTURE OF THE APPLICATION
#MANAGE TO CREATE DATABASE.
#NEED TO EDIT CONTNTE IN THE DATABASE
#MANAGED TO CREATE A DATABASE AND LOAD SOME NEW 
THE BASE.
#MANAGED TO REGISTER USER AND LOGIN
#MANAGED TO HAS REGISTER PASSWORD
#CREATE USER HOMEPAGE
#CREATE A CLASS FOR REGISTER DETAILS
#CREATE AGRGATE OF DATA AND PRINT IT.
#WE WANT TO PASS IN THE USERNAME TO THE DATA
#CREATE A QR CODE BASED ON THE DATA THE USER GIVES ME
#CREATE A JSON FILE THAT STORES OUR USERS DATA.
===================================================
NEED TO CREATE A PROFILE THAT HAS DATA FROM THE
PERIOVUSE FILE.
MANAGED TO CREATE A PROFILE FOR THE USER 
===================================================
TRY TO STRUCTURE THE APPLICATION
#ADD NAVIGATION TO SIGNUP/LOGIN
#MANAGED TO CREATE A TRUCTURE BUT I WANT TO BUILD 
SOMETHING THAT IS MORE INTUTIVE
#SOLVE THE LOGIN SITUATION
#NEED TO CHECK IF USER EXIST IN THE JSON FILE
===================================================
MANAGED TO CREATE A LOGIN SYSTEM.
==================================================
NEED TO REDESIGN THE WHOLE SYSTEM, THE FIRST PART 
WAS USING A DATABASE AND JSON FILE AS A BACK END 
WHAT I NEED TO TO IS RECREATE THE STRUCTURE TO 
SUPPORT CSV AS A BACKEND.
I CAN CHANGE MY JSON FILE TO RECORD THE USERS BALANCE
WRITE DOWN THE BALANCE WITHIN THE JSON
===================================================
I WILL TRY TO RESTRUCTURE THE APPLICATION AND 
CLEAN THE CODE.
