OBTAIN DATA SCRIPTS
CREATE QRCODE BASED ON SCAN
MANAGED TO CREATE SCRIPTS 
THAT ARE ABLE TO READ AND 
WRITE QR CODE, NEXT STEP WOULD BE TO 
CREATE FUNCTIONS AD IMPLEMENT THEM TO
THE APPLICATION
=====================================
CREATE A DEMO SAMPLE DATA WHERE YOU 
CAN READ DATA FROM.
READ SIMPLE DATA
=====================================
HAVE AN ACTION THAT WILL LOAD DATA FROM 
A GIVEN IMAGE CREATE UPLOAD HTML.
WANT TO UPLOAD AN IMAGE SO THAT I CAN 
LOAD SOME DATA INTO IT 
MANAGED TO UPLOAD IMAGES.
MANAGED TO READ QR CODE, WHAT i NEED TO 
DO IS PASS THE DATA SO THAT IT CAN BE READ
BY THE APPLICATION.
CREATE A PROPER QR CODE THAT HAS THE 
NEEDED DATA.
MANAGED TO CREATE A DESCENT JSON FILE, WHAT 
I WANT TO DO NOW IS DISPLAY THE DATA ON THE 
WEB.
===========================================
APPEND THE DATA INTO A JSON FILE 
MANAGED TO UPLOAD DATA INTO THE FILE 
#TRY TO ORDER THE STRUCTURE OF THE APPLICATION
#MANAGE TO CREATE DATABASE.
#NEED TO EDIT CONTNTE IN THE DATABASE
#MANAGED TO CREATE A DATABASE AND LOAD SOME NEW 
THE BASE.
#MANAGED TO REGISTER USER AND LOGIN
#MANAGED TO HAS REGISTER PASSWORD
#CREATE USER HOMEPAGE
#CREATE A CLASS FOR REGISTER DETAILS
#CREATE AGRGATE OF DATA AND PRINT IT.
#WE WANT TO PASS IN THE USERNAME TO THE DATA
#CREATE A QR CODE BASED ON THE DATA THE USER GIVES ME
#CREATE A JSON FILE THAT STORES OUR USERS DATA.
===================================================
NEED TO CREATE A PROFILE THAT HAS DATA FROM THE
PERIOVUSE FILE.
MANAGED TO CREATE A PROFILE FOR THE USER 
===================================================
TRY TO STRUCTURE THE APPLICATION
#ADD NAVIGATION TO SIGNUP/LOGIN
#MANAGED TO CREATE A TRUCTURE BUT I WANT TO BUILD 
SOMETHING THAT IS MORE INTUTIVE
#SOLVE THE LOGIN SITUATION
#NEED TO CHECK IF USER EXIST IN THE JSON FILE
===================================================
MANAGED TO CREATE A LOGIN SYSTEM.
==================================================
NEED TO REDESIGN THE WHOLE SYSTEM, THE FIRST PART 
WAS USING A DATABASE AND JSON FILE AS A BACK END 
WHAT I NEED TO TO IS RECREATE THE STRUCTURE TO 
SUPPORT CSV AS A BACKEND.
I CAN CHANGE MY JSON FILE TO RECORD THE USERS BALANCE
WRITE DOWN THE BALANCE WITHIN THE JSON
===================================================
I WILL TRY TO RESTRUCTURE THE APPLICATION AND 
CLEAN THE CODE.
ON REGISTER TRY TO WRITE THE DATA TO THE JSON FILE
WE CAN'T WRITE TO JSON ON THE SIGN UP SINCE IT HAS NOT 
ID OF THE USER.
#I CAN CREATE THE TOKENS ON THE PROFILE, WHAT I NEED 
DO IS CHECK IF THE USER EXISTS OR NOT.
===================================================
NEED TO RECONSTRUCT THE DESIGN OF THE PROFILE.
THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS CHANGING THE BOOSTRAP.
NEED TO CALUCLATE CURRENCY.
====================================================
CREATE A BLANCE DATA BANCE THAT WILL KEEP RECORD
OF WHO WAS ISSUED THE TOKENS.
CREATE A MASTER DATABASE.
===================================================
GOING TO WORK WITH THE RECIEVE TOKENS SCETION THIS 
WILL INVOLVE CREATING A QR CODE.
NEED TO CREATE A FUNCTION THAT FIND THE USER DATA
WE CAN USE THE DATA TO CREATE A QR CODE
WE NEED TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE IT CREATES AND 
DELETES THE QR CODE.
#MANAGED TO CREATE QR CODE, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS
DELETE AFTER USE
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH FINDING THE CURRENT USER DATA.
MANAGED TO SOLVE TH EUSER LOGIN PROBLEM, WHAT I CAN
DO IS MOVE TO THE TOKEN PART.
=====================================================
MANAGED TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE
VIA TOKENS. WHAT I CAN TRY IS MAKE THE UI MORE FLUID.
WE CAN HAVE A SCAN BUTTON WHERE WE WOULD WANT TO 
INSERT THE VALUE IMAGE TOKEN OF THE USER.
=====================================================
CREATE A SCRIPT THAT CAN READ A QR CODE.
MANAGED TO UPLOAD IMAGE, TAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS DONE 
THOUGH JAVA SCRIPT, I NEED TO FIND A WAY 
TO READ THE DATA AND HAVE A CONFRIMING MECHANISNM
#CREATE AN UPLOAD SECTION.
I WILL NEED TO CREATE A NEW APPLICATION
https://github.com/furas/python-examples/blob/master/flask/web%20camera%20in%20browser%20-%20canvas%20-%20take%20image%20and%20upload%20to%20server/app-3-take-image-and-upload-and-sendback-3-fetch.py
I TRIED A GIT HUB SAMPLE THAT SEEMS TO WORK,
WHAT I NEED TO DO IS SIMPLIFY IT TO 
======================================================
I JUST NEED TO FIND WHERE I CAN GET RID OFF THE 
UNESSECARY VALUES.
WHAT I CAN TRY TO DO IS CHANGE THE APPROACH, USE A DROP 
DOWN LIST INSTEAD WHERE THE USER CAN LOOK AT PREVIOUSE 
ACCOUNTS THAT HE/SHE HAS COMMUNICATED WITH.
=======================================================
CREATED A DROP DOWNLIST , JUST NEED TO EDIT SO 
THAT IT CAN BE FUNCTIONAL.
#MANAGED TO READ DATA FROM JSON FILE.
MANAGED TO READ THE DATA, WHAT I WANT TO DO IS FILTER
IT IN A WAY THAT THE USER IS NOT ABLE TO SEND THEMSELVES MONEY
FILTERED THE USER NAME
